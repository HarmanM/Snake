# Description


Using Daniel Shiffman's challenge as a guide/tutorial, I made my own snake game using p5.js. This functions much like the arcade game, and this game keeps
track of a user's current and highest scores.

I also attempted to use some object orientated javascript while programming this in order to further my understanding of the OO aspects.
